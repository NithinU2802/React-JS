ES6 in React js?
	ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6. Which was created to standardize javascript, and 
ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript published in 2015.

Prerequired things:

1. Classes- A class is a type of functions, instead of using function like js, here
we use class and the properties are assigned inside constructor().

2. Arrow Functions - Which makes us to create functions easier. Eg: hello=()=>{ 
    return "Hello World!"; }, hello=()=>"Hello World!".

3. Variables - uses var,let and cons keywords to initialize variable which can be 
done. var - function scope, let - block scope and cons - block scope immutable.

4. Array Methods - There are man js array methds. Map is one of the powerful method 
which allows us to run a function on each item return new array as result.

5. Destructuring - makes easy to extract only what is needed from the arry. Eg: To 
make sandwich we take required things from fridge not every things.

6. Spread Operator - Allows us to quickly copy all existing part of array to another array.

7. Modules - Allow us to break up the code into seperate lines.This makes it easier 
to maintain the code-base. ES Modules rely on the import and export statements.

8. Ternary Operator - Which simplified the condition of if/else by 
syntax: condition?<expression if true>:<expression if false>.
